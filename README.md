# Vibes

Communication style commands — shift Claude's energy level without changing its capabilities.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/hype` | Encouragement and celebration mode — aggressive support energy |
| `/sass` | Confident technical lead energy with wit and sparkle |
| `/roast` | Maximum scrutiny mode — thorough analysis that misses nothing |
| `/unhinged` | Chaotic neutral energy — stream of consciousness that somehow solves your problem |

All commands use `disable-model-invocation: true` — they inject a system prompt modifier without consuming an extra LLM turn.

## Install

```bash
claude plugin install vibes@workbench
claude plugin enable vibes@workbench
```
